# I Built an AI Tool to Solve My LinkedIn Writer's Block (And You Can Use It Too!)

Ever stared at a blank screen, trying to write the perfect LinkedIn post? 

I've been there. Too many times. 😅

So I did what any developer would do — I built a solution.

## The Problem We All Face

Writing engaging LinkedIn content is HARD. You need:
- The perfect hook to grab attention
- The right tone for your audience  
- Proper formatting for readability
- Time... lots of time

And even after all that effort, you're never quite sure if it'll resonate.

## Introducing PostPilot Lite 🚀

I spent the last few weeks building a free AI-powered web app that helps you:

**✍️ Generate fresh posts** from scratch
- Choose from 6 different tones (Professional, Storytelling, Technical, Personal, Inspirational, Educational)
- Control the length (Short/Medium/Long)
- Add context about your audience and desired call-to-action

**🔄 Rewrite existing content** for new contexts
- Repurpose your best posts
- Adapt content for different events or audiences
- Maintain your unique style

**📊 Optimize your posts** (This is my favorite!)
Here's where it gets interesting. The Optimizer doesn't just tell you what's wrong — it shows you what's right.

You paste your post, and it:
1. Gives you an engagement score (0-100)
2. Provides 3 specific improvement tips
3. Creates **3 fully optimized versions** of your post, each with a unique approach

No more guesswork. No more rewriting from scratch. Just choose your favorite version and hit publish.

**📁 Save your best work**
Everything saves to your browser so you can build a library of proven content.

## The Tech Behind It

For the developers out there 👨‍💻:
- Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript
- Styled with TailwindCSS (yes, those gradients took forever)
- Powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenRouter
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

## Why I'm Sharing This

I could have kept this as a personal tool. But I realized: if I struggle with LinkedIn content, others probably do too.

The goal isn't to automate authenticity — it's to overcome that initial paralysis. To get ideas flowing. To see what "good" looks like.

Think of it as a writing partner, not a replacement for your voice.

## Want to Try It?

The project is open source and free to use. All you need is an OpenRouter API key (which has a generous free tier).

## What's Next?

I'm constantly improving it based on feedback. Some ideas I'm exploring:
- Direct LinkedIn integration
- A/B testing suggestions  
- Analytics on saved posts
- Team collaboration features
